<h3>Greetings Classics,</h3>
  <h4>Here are some rules that we will be following to make sure that it's fair for everyone (pumpers/buyers):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Everyone should use consumables 24/7 during raid.
      <ul>1st time  - Warning</ul>
      <ul>2nd time - 25% deduction</ul>
      <ul>3rd time - 50% deduction</ul>
      <ul>4th time - 100% deduction</ul></li>
  <li>Certain roles will be granted extra gold in addition to their original cuts (supports, tanks, etc.).</li>
  <li>If you come as buyer then you are supposed to Bid on every single item that its potentially a decent upgrade for you not to mention if it's BIS item.</li>
  <li>If low geared/performance buyers don't bid on items as mentioned previously they won't be granted any cut from the run as it's not fair for pumpers.</li>
  <li>Either if you are pumper or buyer which means you should be good player and you do critical mistake that causes noticeable delay in the run you will be deducted some gold from the cut.</li>
  <li>Everyone attending Eldraco GDKP are required to understand and speak English. If you end up wiping the raid because not being able to, we reserve the right to deduct your cut or replace you.</li>
  <li>Any disrespect for anyone in the raid will be treated in same way back to you we are all adults and we come to play and enjoy and start new friendships.</li>
  <li>Discord is mandatory for all raids.</li>
  <li>You can always check the cuts in GDKP channel #‚Å†üí∞gold-split </li>
  <li>To sign up for next GDKP you can navigate to <a href="{% url 'events' %}">events</a> and signup, or post your current gear to be checked in GDKP channel #‚Å†‚öôgear-screenshot and singup in according channel on discord. </li>
  <li>By a pumper it means that you already dont need a single pieces from the encounter as both pumpers and buyers are getting cut.</li>
  </ul>
