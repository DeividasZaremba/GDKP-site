  <h6>Our discord community has reached over 7000 members</h6>

  <p>Our first project is an exciting new initiative designed to foster community development and make signup and raid management easier for everyone involved. The project is currently in development and aims to offer a wide range of features and benefits to players and GDKPs alike. With this project, we hope to provide a centralized platform where players can connect with each other, share their experiences, and organize events and raids with ease.</p>

  <p>We believe that this project has the potential to bring players closer together and create a more vibrant and engaged community. We are committed to making it as user-friendly as possible and will be incorporating feedback and ideas from the community as we continue to develop it. We encourage everyone to get involved and share their ideas and suggestions with us. If you have any questions or would like to contribute in any way, please contact our leadership team via Discord.</p>
    
  <p>Overall, we are thrilled to be working on this project and are excited to see it evolve and grow over time. We believe that it has the potential to be a real game-changer for the community and look forward to seeing the positive impact that it will have on players and GDKPs. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey and help us create a platform that truly serves the needs of our community.</p>
